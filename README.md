# Parental Controls Remover
Parental Control remover application for the Nintendo Wii.

# Why? Don't websites for this exist?
[Yes](https://mkey.nintendohomebrew.com), but they aren't super convenient in a lot of cases. Especially if BlueBomb is an option.

# How do I run this?
Well, here's the thing. Both str2hax and Wilbrand (the common exploits) need parental controls disabled to access Internet Settings. So you can't get the MAC Address for Wilbrand, or set the DNS for str2hax. BlueBomb is the only reasonable exploit that allows this to be ran on a stock Wii. Unfortunately this heavily limits the use cases, though.

You can also run this through the Homebrew Channel, which will be useful in cases with Wiis that already have the Homebrew Channel installed.
